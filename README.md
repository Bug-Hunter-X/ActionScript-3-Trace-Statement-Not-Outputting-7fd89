# ActionScript 3 Trace Statement Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue encountered in ActionScript 3 where the `trace()` statement fails to produce output in certain conditions. The goal is to identify and address the root cause of this unexpected behavior.  The `bug.as` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version.  The circumstances in which the bug occurs are detailed in the bug report.

## Bug Details

The `trace()` statement within the `someFunction()` function should display a message in the output panel. However, under specific conditions (as detailed in `bug.as` and the bug report), this does not happen. The bug is not consistent and might only occur in particular situations related to runtime conditions and the application's overall state.
